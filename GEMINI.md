# Gemini Project: Simple Paper Airplane Game

This project is a simple web-based game where the player controls a paper airplane to avoid obstacles. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Run

This is a client-side JavaScript application. To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the game canvas and includes all the necessary scripts.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styling for the game page.
*   `game.js`: The core game logic, including the game loop, score tracking, and state management.
*   `plane.js`: Defines the player's paper airplane object, its movement, and controls.
*   `obstacle.js`: Defines the obstacle objects that the player must avoid.
*   `particle.js`: Handles particle effects (e.g., for explosions or trails).
*   `physics.js`: Contains basic physics calculations used in the game.
*   `sound.js`: Manages sound effects.
*   `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
*   `.cursor/`: Contains metadata, likely from the Cursor editor.
